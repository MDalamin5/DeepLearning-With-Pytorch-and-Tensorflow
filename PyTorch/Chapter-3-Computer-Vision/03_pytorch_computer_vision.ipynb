    "\n",
    "Now we've got a dataset ready to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to prepare it with a [`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset) or `DataLoader` for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DataLoader` does what you think it might do.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps load data into a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For training and for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns a large `Dataset` into a Python iterable of smaller chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "These smaller chunks are called **batches** or **mini-batches** and can be set by the `batch_size` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it's more computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal world you could do the forward pass and backward pass across all of your data at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "But once you start using really large datasets, unless you've got infinite computing power, it's easier to break them up into batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also gives your model more opportunities to improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "With **mini-batches** (small portions of the data), gradient descent is performed more often per epoch (once per mini-batch rather than once per epoch).\n",
    "\n",
    "What's a good batch size?\n",
    "\n",
    "[32 is a good place to start](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/989610208497360896?s=20&t=N96J_jotN--PYuJk2WcjMw) for a fair amount of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "But since this is a value you can set (a **hyperparameter**) you can try all different kinds of values, though generally powers of 2 are used most often (e.g. 32, 64, 128, 256, 512).\n",
