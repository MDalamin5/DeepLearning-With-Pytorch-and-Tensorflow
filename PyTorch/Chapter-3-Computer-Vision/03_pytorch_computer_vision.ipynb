    "| **2. Prepare data** | We've got some images, let's load them in with a [PyTorch `DataLoader`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html) so we can use them with our training loop. |\n",
    "| **3. Model 0: Building a baseline model** | Here we'll create a multi-class classification model to learn patterns in the data, we'll also choose a **loss function**, **optimizer** and build a **training loop**. | \n",
    "| **4. Making predictions and evaluating model 0** | Let's make some predictions with our baseline model and evaluate them. |\n",
    "| **5. Setup device agnostic code for future models** | It's best practice to write device-agnostic code, so let's set it up. |\n",
    "| **6. Model 1: Adding non-linearity** | Experimenting is a large part of machine learning, let's try and improve upon our baseline model by adding non-linear layers. |\n",
